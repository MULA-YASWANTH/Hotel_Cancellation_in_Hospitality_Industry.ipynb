# Predictive Analysis and Insights on Hotel Booking Cancellations


This project involves analyzing the hotel booking dataset to identify factors influencing cancellations and predicting future cancellation trends. It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing booking patterns, seasonality, and customer preferences.
Feature Engineering: Selecting key variables like lead time, market segment, and deposit type that influence cancellations.
Predictive Modeling: Building a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest) to predict the likelihood of a booking being canceled.
Insights and Recommendations: Offering actionable insights for hotel management, such as customer retention strategies or policies to reduce cancellations.
Skills Highlighted:
Data wrangling and preprocessing.
Visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Machine learning model development and evaluation.
Insights generation and communication of results.
